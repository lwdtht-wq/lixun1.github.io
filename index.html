 <h1>Mosaic of Faith: The Distribution of Religious Beliefs in Singapore</h1>
 <section>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Singapore is a multicultural and multi-ethnic society where religion plays an important role in shaping both social structures and 
cultural identity. 
Different religions not only influence people’s lifestyles, festivals, and values but also shape the diversity of public spaces 
(e.g., temples, mosques, and churches coexisting). However, with globalization and secularization, the structure of religious belief is 
changing—for example, 
the rise of the “no religion” group among younger generations.

<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>To outline the distribution and proportion of major religious groups in Singapore (e.g., Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, 
Taoism).</li>
<li>To explore the role of religion in public life, festivals, and community activities.</li>
<li>To analyze the influence of different religious groups on social interaction and cultural identity.</li>
<li>To compare differences in religious beliefs across age groups and ethnic communities.</li>
</ul>
 </section>
